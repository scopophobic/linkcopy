<h1 align="center">🔗 SmartCopy - Clean URL Saver</h1>

---

### ✨ Motivation

This project was born out of a small but powerful feature I noticed in the Arc Browser — the ability to copy the current page’s URL instantly with a shortcut key. Most other browsers don’t offer this natively, and I found that really inconvenient. So I built this extension to bring that seamless experience elsewhere.

### 💡 What It Does

**SmartCopy** is a Chrome extension that:

- Copies the current tab’s URL to your clipboard with a single shortcut.
- Prevents duplicate URLs from being added repeatedly.
- Saves the last **10 unique copied links** for quick access later.
- Shows a subtle in-page toast notification when a URL is copied.

> 🔜 Coming soon: Firefox version!

### ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcut

By default:  
**`Ctrl + Shift + C`** (or **`⌘ + Shift + C`** on macOS)

> You can customize this via `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`
